# MVC_to_REST_migration
This is part of an educational project, a series of lessons in which I teach students how to migrate from MVC to API REST applying clean code and several structure improvements. The Project is separated into different versions corresponding to the process we go through lesson to lesson. Read the README file for more information about the different versions.
